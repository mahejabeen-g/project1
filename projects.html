        <p>  It is to develop an Automatic Braking System for Automobiles in order to avoid accidents.
             This project is necessary to be attached to every vehicle.
             It is mainly beneficial for the drivers who might be tired on their long commutes during day/night and may hit
             another vehicle or road side trees etc, or they might get distracted, which can be dangerous.
             Driving is a common activity for most of the people. The number of vehicles is
           increasing day by day. Now a days, the technology has got vast changes which
            leads increase in speed. The speed plays a vital role to maintain time for longer
           distances. But, this speed also getting a major problem for causes of road
            accidents. The common braking is not sufficient for avoidance of accidents
           when driver is not active. Further improvement has to done in braking system in
            order to brake a vehicle when driver is not able to brake i.e., it may needs
            automatic braking system.
          This automatic braking system allows the vehicle to brake without support of 
          the driver. The main target of the ultrasonic braking system is that, vehicles
          should automatically brake when the sensors sense the obstacle. This is a
         technology for automobiles to sense an imminent forward collision with another
          vehicle or an obstacle, and to brake the vehicle accordingly, which is done by
          the braking circuit.

        <h2><u>Monitoring Of Hydroponics Using Iot</u></h2>
        <p>
            Hydroponics is a method of growing plants using water rather than soil. The success of a hydroponic system is largely
             dependent on the ability to monitor and control various environmental factors. The monitoring of a hydroponic system involves
              the continuous measurement and adjustment of water, nutrient, temperature, humidity, and lighting conditions 
              to ensure optimal growth and health of the plants.
            The project involves designing and implementing a monitoring system for a hydroponic setup to ensure optimal growth and health of the plants.
            The monitoring system will consist of various sensors and tools such as Turbidity sensor, temperature sensor and ultrasonic sensor. 
            The system will continuously measure and adjust various environmental factors to maintain ideal conditions for the plants.
             These tools will be integrated into a centralized control system, which will allow growers to remotely monitor and control their hydroponic setup from anywhere.
            The project will also involve developing a software interface that displays real-time data and provides alerts when any parameter goes outside the optimal range.
             This will enable growers to take corrective action before any damage occurs to the plants.
           The project aims to provide an efficient and effective solution for monitoring hydroponic systems and enabling growers to optimize plant growth and yield.
          Overall, this project has the potential to contribute to the development of sustainable agriculture and promote
            the adoption of hydroponic farming[1] by making it easier and more accessible for growers
